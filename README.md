# 🤪 NLP: Not-So-Literal Playground

Dive into a quirky collection of Jupyter Notebooks where language and code meet for unexpected adventures! This repository is all about experimenting with natural language processing—sometimes things get weird, sometimes things get wonderful, but it’s always a learning experience.

Tinker with text, explore algorithms, or just see how machines try to make sense of our messy human language. Mistakes, surprises, and “aha!” moments are all part of the journey.

Curious minds welcome—bring your favorite dataset and let’s get linguistically adventurous!
